  <div class="grid-2">
    <div class="card">
      <h3>1. Pick a Picture</h3>
      <p>Your child can choose from a gallery of fun pictures. Starting with a template helps them get creative right away as they prepare to add color.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>2. Choose Your Colors</h3>
      <p>Next, they select colors from the palette. This step encourages them to experiment and think about which colors will look best together in their painting.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>3. Create a Masterpiece</h3>
      <p>As they fill in the picture, children experiment with color combinations and develop their artistic style. This process builds confidence and improves creative skills.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>4. Save and Share</h3>
      <p>Once their painting is complete, you can save it to your device. This allows you to track their progress and share their achievements with family and friends.</p>
