    <p style="font-size: 1.15em; max-width: 800px; margin: 20px auto; line-height: 1.8;">
      In a world of complex apps, we believe exploring art should be simple and safe. Creative Coloring was born from the idea that giving a child a digital canvas to paint on should be as easy as opening a browser.

  <h2>The Benefits of Digital Painting</h2>
  <p style="text-align: center; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto 40px; font-size: 1.1em;">
    Creative Coloring is more than just a game—it's a tool for your child's development. Here are the skills they can build while they paint:
  </p>
  <div class="grid-2">
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Improved Fine Motor Skills</h3>
      <p>The act of selecting colors and filling in shapes helps children practice hand-eye coordination and strengthens the muscles in their hands needed for writing and other activities.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Enhanced Concentration</h3>
      <p>Focusing on a painting task helps improve a child's attention span and ability to concentrate, building valuable skills for school and other activities.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Color & Shape Recognition</h3>
      <p>As they play, children learn to identify different colors and shapes, building a fundamental vocabulary for understanding art and the world around them.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Artistic Confidence</h3>
      <p>Digital painting provides a creative outlet for self-expression. Completing a picture gives children a sense of accomplishment and boosts their artistic confidence.</p>
